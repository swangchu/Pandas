# Read data from the external csv file
# Display data using tail() method

import pandas as pd

# pandas provides the read_csv() function to read data stored as a csv file into a pandas DataFrame. 
# pandas supports many different file formats or data sources out of the box (csv, excel, sql, json, parquet, â€¦), 
# each of them with the prefix read_*.

# Here we will read a csv file of Bhutanese movies

movies = pd.read_csv("Bhutanese.movies.csv")
# Here dataset is converted to dataframe called movies

# The method info() provides technical information about a DataFrame
# It gives the summary of the dataframe

summary = movies.info()
print(summary)
