# Read data from the external csv file

import pandas as pd

# pandas provides the read_csv() function to read data stored as a csv file into a pandas DataFrame. 
# pandas supports many different file formats or data sources out of the box (csv, excel, sql, json, parquet, â€¦), 
# each of them with the prefix read_*.

# Here we will read a csv file of Bhutanese movies

movies = pd.read_csv("Bhutanese.movies.csv")

# This will display all the data in the csv file
# usually we get data from the external files

print(movies)
