# select specific rows and columns from a DataFrame
# using loc() method

import pandas as pd

# pandas provides the read_csv() function to read data stored as a csv file into a pandas DataFrame. 
# pandas supports many different file formats or data sources out of the box (csv, excel, sql, json, parquet, â€¦), 
# each of them with the prefix read_*.

# Here we will read a csv file of Bhutanese movies

movies = pd.read_csv("Bhutanese.movies.csv")

# Here dataset is converted to dataframe called movies

# In this case, a subset of both rows and columns is made in one go 
# and just using selection brackets [] is not sufficient anymore. 
# The loc/iloc operators are required in front of the selection brackets [].
#  When using loc/iloc, the part before the comma is the rows you want, and 
# the part after the comma is the columns you want to select.

# List names of the movies with duration more than 100 minutes

movie_length_100 = movies.loc[movies["Length"]>=100, "Movie"]

print(movie_length_100)

# When using the column names, row labels or a condition expression, 
# use the loc operator in front of the selection brackets []. 
# For both the part before and after the comma, you can use a single label, 
# a list of labels, a slice of labels, a conditional expression or a colon. 
# Using a colon specifies you want to select all rows or columns.
